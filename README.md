A course to make a static file server

This project helped me understanding how a basic server works, 
how to use some basic methods to request data, 
and how to give a reaction with data. 

It is possible to see some very basic html document, 
An image and some paths are better specified. 
I tried to show the list of files in a directory with fs.readFile, 
although this didn’t work out how i wanted. 
I could see the list in my bash, 
but i couldn’t fix it to see it in an html file.
